# Building a Frontend with Lovable.dev for Your Strapi Backend

AI tools like [Lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev) and [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) can help you spin up projects faster than ever. But from my experience in vibe coding, I've learned they're not magic bullets—you still need to know what you're building, understand your data, the problems you're trying to solve, and the tech stack you're using to get good output. (And yes—you still need to know how to code.)

These tools are powerful, but they're also prone to hallucinations and mistakes. The better you understand your project's architecture and how these tools work, the more effective you'll be.

In this post, I'll share a high-level overview of building a frontend with Lovable.dev connected to a Strapi backend. There's a lot to unpack, so I'll follow up with deeper dives and answer questions in future posts.

Let's get the SEO stuff out of the way. (I promise I will be quick)

## What is Lovable.dev?

Lovable.dev is a browser-based AI-powered development platform that generates full-stack web applications using natural language prompts. Similar to V0 by Vercel, Lovable takes your descriptions and turns them into working code—but goes further by providing a complete development environment with instant preview, version control, and deployment capabilities.

**Key features of Lovable.dev include:**

- **AI-assisted full-stack development**: Describe what you want in natural language, and Lovable generates React components, pages, backend logic, and database schemas.
- **Instant preview and iteration**: See your changes live as Lovable builds your application. Refine and adjust with follow-up prompts.
- **Integrated deployment**: Deploy your application directly from Lovable to production with a few clicks.
- **Real-time collaboration**: Work alongside the AI, reviewing and guiding the generated code as it builds your application.

## What is Vibe Coding?

Vibe coding is a chill, creative development session where you use AI tools to prototype and build applications in a flow state.

Instead of the traditional, step-by-step coding from scratch, you describe what you want in natural language and let the AI generate the code, guiding it iteratively.

The "vibe" comes from maintaining momentum and curiosity—trying things out quickly without getting bogged down in setup or syntax issues.

**Key characteristics of vibe coding include:**

- **AI-assisted coding**: You use an AI tool (like Lovable.dev or V0) as a pair programmer. The AI can generate React components, pages, styles, and even connect to APIs based on your instructions.
- **Rapid prototyping**: The goal is to get a working prototype up and running quickly. It's about turning ideas into working code in minutes or hours, not days, by letting the AI handle the heavy lifting of boilerplate code generation.
- **Iterative exploration**: You don't necessarily have a fully specified end product from the start. Instead, you prompt the AI to build one piece at a time, refining and adding features in short cycles.
- **Human oversight**: Importantly, vibe coding doesn't mean the AI does everything perfectly. Think of it like working with a junior developer—you get raw productivity, but you also need to review and guide carefully.

**What is Claude Code?** (by Anthropic) A terminal-based AI coding assistant that acts as an autonomous developer—able to read, write, debug, and execute code across your full-stack project, guided by you.

[Ok, back to content.]

## Why Use Lovable.dev with Strapi?

When building a content-driven application, you have several approaches:

1. **Start with the frontend** - Design and build the UI first, then create the backend to match
2. **Start with the backend** - Model your data and API first, then build the frontend to consume it
3. **Build them in parallel** - Develop both simultaneously (often leads to mismatches and rework)

**For this tutorial, we're taking the backend-first approach with Strapi. Here's why:**

### Pros of Starting with Strapi Backend:

- **Data structure defines your UI**: Your content model naturally informs what components and pages you need
- **Type safety from the start**: Generate TypeScript types from your API schema, reducing runtime errors
- **Real data during development**: Test with actual content instead of mock data
- **OpenAPI specification**: Strapi can generate an OpenAPI spec that AI tools can consume, providing perfect context about your API structure
- **Content flexibility**: Non-technical users can start adding content while you build the frontend

### Cons of Backend-First Approach:

- **Upfront planning required**: You need to think through your content model before seeing visual results
- **Potential for over-engineering**: Easy to add fields and relationships you might not need
- **Less visual feedback early**: You won't see the UI until later in the process

Despite the cons, the backend-first approach with Strapi provides the strongest foundation for AI-assisted frontend development—especially when using OpenAPI specifications.

## What is OpenAPI and Why Should You Use It?

**OpenAPI Specification (formerly Swagger)** is a standardized, language-agnostic way to describe RESTful APIs. It's essentially a contract that defines:

- Available endpoints and operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
- Request parameters and their types
- Request and response body schemas
- Authentication methods
- Error responses

Here's a simple example of what an OpenAPI spec looks like:

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
paths:
  /api/articles:
    get:
      summary: Get all articles
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Success
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  data:
                    type: array
                    items:
                      $ref: '#/components/schemas/Article'
components:
  schemas:
    Article:
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: integer
        title:
          type: string
        content:
          type: string
```

### Why OpenAPI is Perfect for AI-Assisted Development:

1. **Eliminates hallucinations**: Instead of the AI guessing your API structure, it has the exact specification
2. **Type-safe code generation**: AI can generate TypeScript interfaces that perfectly match your backend
3. **Accurate API calls**: The AI knows exactly what endpoints exist, what parameters they accept, and what they return
4. **Documentation as context**: OpenAPI serves as both human and machine-readable documentation
5. **Automatic validation**: You can validate requests/responses against the spec

### Generating OpenAPI Spec in Strapi

Strapi makes it incredibly easy to generate an OpenAPI specification for your API:

```bash
# Generate OpenAPI spec
npx strapi openapi generate

# This creates an openapi.json file in your project root
```

You can also access the OpenAPI spec via HTTP when your Strapi server is running:

```
http://localhost:1337/api/documentation
```

The generated spec includes all your content types, components, and API endpoints with complete type definitions—perfect for feeding into AI tools like Lovable.dev.

## Tutorial: Building a Frontend with Lovable.dev for Your Strapi Backend

Now let's walk through the actual process of building a frontend with Lovable.dev connected to a Strapi backend.

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, here are the key questions to ask:

- ✅ Do you already have a Strapi project? (If not, we'll create one)
- ✅ Do you have content types defined in Strapi?
- ✅ Is your Strapi API accessible (locally or deployed)?

**Important Safety Note:** Never point your AI tools directly at your production database or server. Always use a dev environment. It's surprisingly easy to trigger thousands of API requests in seconds and accidentally DDoS yourself—or cause even bigger problems—if you're not careful.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Strapi Project

If you don't have a Strapi project yet, create one:

```bash
npx create-strapi-app@latest my-strapi-backend

# Choose your preferences:
# - Choose your installation type: Quickstart (recommended)
# - Start with TypeScript? Yes
```

For this tutorial, let's build a simple blog platform. Create the following content types in Strapi:

**Article Content Type:**
- title (Text)
- description (Text)
- content (Rich Text)
- slug (UID based on title)
- coverImage (Media - Single)
- category (Relation to Category)
- author (Relation to Author)
- publishedAt (DateTime)

**Category Content Type:**
- name (Text)
- slug (UID based on name)

**Author Content Type:**
- name (Text)
- bio (Text)
- avatar (Media - Single)

Make sure to enable public access to these content types in Settings → Users & Permissions → Roles → Public.

### Step 2: Generate Your OpenAPI Specification

With your content types created, generate the OpenAPI spec:

```bash
# In your Strapi project directory
npx strapi openapi generate
```

This creates an `openapi.json` file. You can also install the Strapi Documentation plugin for a better experience:

```bash
npm install @strapi/plugin-documentation
```

Then access the interactive documentation at `http://localhost:1337/documentation/v1.0.0`.

### Step 3: Deploy Strapi (Optional but Recommended)

For easier integration with Lovable.dev, deploy your Strapi project to [Strapi Cloud](https://strapi.io/cloud) (free tier available):

```bash
# Install Strapi Cloud CLI
npm install -g @strapi/cloud-cli

# Login and deploy
strapi login
strapi deploy
```

Alternatively, you can run Strapi locally and use tools like ngrok to expose it temporarily.

### Step 4: Prepare Your Context for Lovable.dev

Before jumping into Lovable.dev, gather the following:

1. **Your OpenAPI specification** (openapi.json file)
2. **A sample API response** from an endpoint like `/api/articles?populate=*`
3. **Your design preferences** (color scheme, layout style, component library preferences)

### Step 5: Craft Your Prompt for Lovable.dev

Based on the best practices from the V0 article, here's a comprehensive prompt structure for Lovable.dev:

```txt
You are a senior frontend developer experienced with TypeScript, React, and building dynamic content-driven websites that consume RESTful APIs.

TASK: Build a blog platform frontend that consumes a Strapi backend API.

TECH STACK:
- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Modern React patterns (hooks, functional components)

BACKEND CONTEXT:
My Strapi backend is available at: [YOUR_STRAPI_URL]
I have provided the complete OpenAPI specification below in <openapi-spec>.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Home Page / Article Listing
   - Display all published articles in a grid layout
   - Show title, description, cover image, category, and author for each article
   - Implement search functionality to filter by title or category
   - Add pagination (12 articles per page)
   - Make article cards clickable to navigate to detail page

2. Article Detail Page
   - Use slug-based routing (/articles/[slug])
   - Display full article with cover image, title, author info, category, and rich text content
   - Render the rich text content properly (headings, paragraphs, lists, etc.)
   - Show related articles from the same category

3. Category Filter Page
   - Allow users to filter articles by category
   - Display category name and article count
   - Reuse article grid component

4. API Integration
   - Create a type-safe API client based on the OpenAPI spec
   - Use the Strapi REST API with proper population of relations
   - Handle loading states and errors gracefully
   - Implement proper TypeScript types for all API responses

5. Navigation
   - Header with logo and navigation links
   - Footer with site information
   - Mobile-responsive navigation menu

CONSTRAINTS:
- Follow the exact API structure defined in the OpenAPI specification
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Ensure responsive design (mobile-first approach)
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Follow React best practices (no prop drilling, proper component composition)

OPENAPI SPECIFICATION:
<openapi-spec>
[Paste your openapi.json content here]
</openapi-spec>

SAMPLE API RESPONSE:
<sample-response>
[Paste a sample response from /api/articles?populate=* here]
</sample-response>

DELIVERABLE:
A complete, working blog frontend with:
1. TypeScript interfaces generated from OpenAPI spec
2. API client with type-safe methods
3. Reusable components (ArticleCard, ArticleDetail, CategoryFilter, etc.)
4. Routing setup with dynamic routes
5. Responsive layout with Tailwind CSS
```

### Step 6: Build with Lovable.dev

1. **Create a new project** in Lovable.dev
2. **Paste your comprehensive prompt** including the OpenAPI spec and sample response
3. **Let Lovable generate the initial code** - Review the generated structure
4. **Iterate with follow-up prompts** to refine specific features:
   - "Add a search debounce to avoid excessive API calls"
   - "Improve the article card hover effects"
   - "Add a loading skeleton for better UX"
   - "Implement infinite scroll instead of pagination"

### Step 7: Test and Refine

As Lovable builds your application:

1. **Test API connectivity** - Ensure CORS is properly configured in Strapi
2. **Verify data rendering** - Check that all fields display correctly
3. **Test error handling** - Try invalid slugs, network failures, etc.
4. **Check responsive design** - Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
5. **Optimize performance** - Look for unnecessary re-renders or API calls

### Step 8: Deploy Your Frontend

Lovable.dev provides integrated deployment options:

1. **Click the Deploy button** in Lovable.dev
2. **Configure environment variables** (your Strapi API URL)
3. **Deploy to production** - Lovable typically uses Vercel or similar platforms

## Best Practices for Using OpenAPI with AI Tools

### 1. Keep Your Spec Updated

Whenever you modify your Strapi content types, regenerate the OpenAPI spec:

```bash
npx strapi openapi generate
```

### 2. Use Populate Parameters

Strapi requires explicit population of relations. Make sure your prompts include this:

```
When fetching articles, always use ?populate=* or populate specific fields:
/api/articles?populate[author]=*&populate[category]=*&populate[coverImage]=*
```

### 3. Provide Real Data Examples

Don't just provide the OpenAPI spec—also include actual API responses. This helps the AI understand the data structure in practice:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "attributes": {
        "title": "Getting Started with Strapi",
        "slug": "getting-started-with-strapi",
        "description": "Learn how to build with Strapi",
        "content": "...",
        "publishedAt": "2025-01-15T10:00:00.000Z",
        "author": {
          "data": {
            "id": 1,
            "attributes": {
              "name": "John Doe",
              "bio": "Developer Advocate"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "pagination": {
      "page": 1,
      "pageSize": 25,
      "pageCount": 1,
      "total": 1
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Handle Strapi's Data Structure

Strapi wraps data in `data` and `attributes` objects. Make sure your prompt addresses this:

```
Note: Strapi returns data in the format:
{
  data: {
    id: number,
    attributes: { /* actual fields */ }
  }
}

Create helper functions to unwrap this structure for easier component usage.
```

### 5. Implement Proper Error Handling

Guide the AI to handle common Strapi errors:

```
Implement error handling for:
- 404 Not Found (invalid slug or ID)
- 403 Forbidden (permission issues)
- 500 Server Error
- Network failures
- CORS issues
```

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Pitfall 1: Vague Prompts Lead to Generic Code

**Problem**: Asking Lovable to "build a blog" without providing context results in generic, non-functional code that doesn't match your API.

**Solution**: Always provide your OpenAPI spec and sample responses. Be specific about required features and data relationships.

### Pitfall 2: Ignoring Strapi's Data Structure

**Problem**: The AI generates code expecting flat data objects, but Strapi returns nested `data` and `attributes`.

**Solution**: Explicitly mention Strapi's data structure in your prompt and request utility functions to normalize the data.

### Pitfall 3: Missing CORS Configuration

**Problem**: Your frontend can't connect to Strapi due to CORS restrictions.

**Solution**: Configure CORS in your Strapi project (`config/middlewares.ts`):

```typescript
export default [
  // ...other middleware
  {
    name: 'strapi::cors',
    config: {
      enabled: true,
      origin: ['http://localhost:3000', 'https://your-frontend-domain.com'],
    },
  },
];
```

### Pitfall 4: Over-fetching or Under-fetching Data

**Problem**: Not populating relations results in missing data, or populating everything causes performance issues.

**Solution**: Be specific about which relations to populate:

```
For article listing: populate=coverImage,category,author
For article detail: populate=*
```

### Pitfall 5: Runaway API Calls

**Problem**: AI-generated code may create infinite loops or excessive API calls.

**Solution**: Implement debouncing, proper dependency arrays in useEffect, and rate limiting:

```typescript
// Add to your prompt:
"Implement search with 300ms debounce to prevent excessive API calls.
Ensure useEffect hooks have proper dependency arrays to avoid infinite loops.
Add request caching where appropriate."
```

## Prompting Best Practices for Lovable.dev

When working with Lovable.dev (similar to V0), follow these best practices:

### 1. Define the Role and Context

```txt

- Axios or Fetch for API calls
```

### 3. Provide Complete API Context

```txt
BACKEND:
- Strapi v5 headless CMS
- Base URL: https://your-strapi.com
- Authentication: None required (public API)
- OpenAPI spec provided below
```

### 4. List Specific Requirements

```txt
REQUIREMENTS:
1. Feature one with specific details
2. Feature two with acceptance criteria
3. Feature three with edge cases to handle
```

### 5. Set Constraints

```txt
CONSTRAINTS:
- Must use the exact API structure from OpenAPI spec
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- No client-side state management library (use React Context if needed)
```

### 6. Include Data Structures

```txt
<openapi-spec>
[Your full OpenAPI specification]
</openapi-spec>

<sample-data>
[Real API response example]
</sample-data>
```

## Example Workflow: Start to Finish

Let me walk you through a complete example:

### 1. Create Strapi Project

```bash
npx create-strapi-app@latest blog-backend --quickstart
```

### 2. Create Content Types

- Article (title, slug, content, coverImage, author, category)
- Author (name, bio, avatar)
- Category (name, slug)

### 3. Add Sample Content

Create 5-10 articles with various categories and authors.

### 4. Generate OpenAPI Spec

```bash
npx strapi openapi generate
```

### 5. Deploy to Strapi Cloud

```bash
strapi deploy
```

### 6. Copy OpenAPI Spec and Sample Response

```bash
# Get OpenAPI spec
cat openapi.json

# Get sample response (using curl or browser)
curl "https://your-strapi.strapiapp.com/api/articles?populate=*"
```

### 7. Create Lovable.dev Project

Paste your comprehensive prompt with OpenAPI spec and sample data.

### 8. Generate Initial Code

Let Lovable build the foundation.

### 9. Iterate with Specific Prompts

```txt
"Add a sticky header that changes background on scroll"
"Implement breadcrumb navigation on article detail pages"
"Add social share buttons (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn)"
"Create a 'Read More' section with related articles"
```

### 10. Deploy

Use Lovable's integrated deployment or export the code to your preferred hosting.

## Lessons Learned

After building multiple projects with this approach, here are key insights:

### OpenAPI Specifications Eliminate Guesswork

Providing the complete API schema upfront prevents the AI from hallucinating endpoints or field names. The code generated is immediately compatible with your backend.

### Backend-First Reduces Rework

When your data model is solidified before building the UI, you avoid constant refactoring. The content structure informs the component architecture naturally.

### Iterative Prompting Beats One-Shots

While comprehensive initial prompts are important, breaking down features into smaller, focused follow-up prompts produces better results and allows for course correction.

### Real Data Reveals Edge Cases

Testing with actual content from Strapi reveals issues that mock data hides: long titles, missing images, empty states, malformed content, etc.

### CORS and Permissions Trip Everyone Up

Always configure CORS properly and verify public API access in Strapi before blaming the frontend code.

## Moving Beyond Lovable.dev

Once you have a solid prototype from Lovable.dev, you might want to:

1. **Export the code** and continue development locally
2. **Use Claude Code** for advanced refactoring and optimization
3. **Add testing** with Jest and React Testing Library
4. **Implement CI/CD** with GitHub Actions
5. **Add advanced features** like authentication, comments, etc.

This is where tools like Claude Code shine—you can have autonomous agents work on specific features while you maintain oversight.

## Conclusion

Building a frontend with Lovable.dev for your Strapi backend is remarkably efficient when you leverage OpenAPI specifications. The key is providing comprehensive context upfront: your API schema, sample data, technical constraints, and specific requirements.

Remember these core principles:

- **Backend-first with Strapi** gives you a solid foundation
- **OpenAPI specs** eliminate AI hallucinations and ensure type safety
- **Detailed prompts** with real data produce better results
- **Iterative refinement** beats trying to generate everything at once
- **Human oversight** remains critical—review, test, and guide the AI

AI tools like Lovable.dev aren't replacing developers—they're amplifying our ability to build faster and experiment more freely. But you still need to understand your data model, API contracts, and application architecture to use them effectively.

Start with a clear Strapi backend, generate that OpenAPI spec, craft a comprehensive prompt, and let Lovable.dev accelerate your frontend development. Just remember: the AI is your collaborator, not your replacement.
